I'm going back to basics, tackling the age-old Fizzbuzz algorithm.
To be honest I'm not sure *how* old it is but i know it's a basic problem to solve.
I should probably be tackling more basic algorithms, like sorting ones, instead, but oh well.
I've determined I want to take advantage of some of Java's libraries so I'm using the FileWriter class
to print the output of the program to a text file.
Unfortunately... I've run into a problem that I'm intent on solving more on principle than for any practical purpose.

My take on Fizzbuzz prints out a number and its corresponding Fizz and Buzz right after. 
The problem arises when i try to print out the number.

This problem, in which brackets and strange characters are printed
